    <h1>Exercise round 3</h1>
    <p>
      If you are seeing this, your setup should be ready for the third
      exercise round. Try to do the exercises in order. The questionnaire
      might give some hints that can be useful in the latter exercises. The
      urls.py made in 3.2 and the models made in 3.3 are needed for 3.4.
